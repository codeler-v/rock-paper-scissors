# Rock-Paper-Scissor
## Overview

This project is a browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game built with vanilla JavaScript, transitioning from a console-based implementation to an interactive UI-driven experience.

The game allows the user to play against the computer using buttons, featuring live score updates and game state control.

## Features

* **Button-based user input:** No more annoying browser prompts.
* **Randomized computer selection:** Fair AI logic.
* **Live Feedback:** Instant display of user and computer choices.
* **Running Scoreboard:** Tracks points in real-time.
* **Win Conditions:** First player to reach 5 wins is the champion.
* **Game Controls:** Integrated Play and Reset functionality.
* **UI State Management:** Buttons dynamically enable/disable based on game status.

## How to Play

1. Click **Play** to start the session.
2. Choose **Rock, Paper, or Scissors** by clicking the icons.
3. The first player to reach **5 wins** is declared the winner.
4. Click **Reset** to clear the score and start over.

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (DOM manipulation & event handling)

## What I Learned

* **Event-driven programming:** Moving away from linear script execution to responding to user actions.
* **State Management:** Managing application data without needing a page reload.
* **Dynamic DOM Updates:** Using JS to change what the user sees on the fly.
* **UX Improvement:** Replacing blocking input (`prompt`) with a fluid, interactive UI.
